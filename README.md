# Pathfinding Problem
This is a machine learning deep Q algorithm that acts as an intelligent agent on an 8x8 board. The object of the game is to find the treasure before the human opponent does. As you can see from the results, the algorihtm finds its way to the treasure.

The biggest thing I learned in this course was the different types of machine learning algorithms. We got to experiment with different algorithms. The different machine learning algorithms tend to specialize in different types of problems.

Now that I have a new understanding of different machine learning algorithms, I think I can better identify a problem where machine learning could be used. I think I could select the proper algorithm and synthesize a rough outline of how the model could be used to solve the problem and how to train it.

The ethics of machine learning are unwritten. There have been attempts to push developers into ethical directions, but there are no concrete regulations that are AI-specific. I think there is a responsibility in every developer to weigh the risks and rewards. In theory, that sounds easy, but is it? One of the things we saw first hand in the assignments was how "black box" the trained algorithms actually are. Unlike software, where you can plainly see the code that generated the result, a model is much more difficult to inspect. To replace this, adequate testing needs to be done to ensure the model acts as intended in the wild.

There is no cut and dry solution that fits every application of machine learning. Simpiler algorithms like the written number identifier may be much easier to test. A more complicated model like text-to-image generation may take vastly more testing to validate.

A priority should always be consumer protection. The models that get created should never be able to harm those who interact with it. An interesting ethic debate is probability. Suppose the probabiliy of harm to a consumer is 0.01%. It is unlikely that the consumer will be harmed, but there still is a chance. What percentage (probability) is acceptable to ship to consumers? It is impossible to be risk-free, but what level of risk are we comfortable with? Is this a number that society must agree on or will there never be a consensus of the acceptable level of risk? Whatever the case may be, and until there exists more clarity on what society expects, it is in the developers best interest to mimize harm probabilty throughout the development process.
